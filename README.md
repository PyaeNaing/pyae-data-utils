# pyae-data-utils

***
I created this package so I can use it's function across my projects.
The package mostly contains array / object manipulation that I could not find on stack-overflow (I.E filtering array of objects by another object with unknown key). Feel free to use / "borrow" them.

***

### Util functions

This functions filter unwanted object data from array

`narrowObjectArray`
This function is to narrow down data from array to show the one you desires

`replaceNullWithValue` 
This function takes in an object and replace the null property of object with the value you provide
